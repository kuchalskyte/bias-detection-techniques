# Generalised Bias Detection Techniques

This folder contains generalised implementations of the three bias detection techniques. These functions are designed to be dataset-agnostic, allowing users to apply them directly to their own data.

The folder includes the code for Technique A - Wasserstein Analysis, Technique B - AUC Analysis and Technique C - Error Variance Analysis.

In order to run the Example Usage of the techniques, in the `Example Folder` all workbooks present in this folder need to be run first.
